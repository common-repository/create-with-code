Create with code lets you quickly embed and run your python projects in your website / blog

== Description ==

create.withcode.uk lets you write, run, debug and share python code in your browser. This plugin lets you quickly embed your code projects in your wordpress site

When you share a project from create.withcode.uk, you get a URL like: https://create.withcode.uk/embed/3C or https://create.withcode.uk/run/3C

Take the last section of the URL and use it in the shortcode to embed it in your wordpress site:

`[withcode id="3C"]`

You can customise choose to display the code or run it using the mode attribute:

`[withcode id="3C" mode="embed"]` 
or 

`[withcode id="3C" mode="run"]`

You can also specifiy the height / width of the code snippet:

`[withcode id="3C" mode="embed" width="400px" height="600px"]`

You can customise the colour scheme by rotating all the colours on the toolbar icons by a hue value:
`[withcode id="3C" hue="45"]`

Or you can make the toolbar icons greyscale as follows:
`[withcode id="3C" grey="1"]`

### Please note:
This plugin just lets you embed python code from create.withcode.uk in a wordpress site. 
The python code can be run in an iframe in your site by pressing `Ctrl + Enter` to run the whole program or `Ctrl + Space` to run one line at a time.
Python code is interpreted and run in the client's browser: it doesn't run on your server and it only supports a sandboxed subset of the fully python language.
This is designed as a teaching and learning aid rather than a fully fledged professional development tool.
